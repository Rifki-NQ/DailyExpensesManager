// if the available free_to_spend does not fully cover daily expenses.

free to spend allocation:
coffee: 10000 / day
snack: 10000 / day
ice cream: 0 / day <- // this has value of zero because entries no 1 and 2 (coffee and snack)
                      // already takes all daily free to spend bills with nothing left for entry no 3 (ice cream)
